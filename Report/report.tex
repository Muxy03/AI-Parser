\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is use AI as a tool to design and implement a Markdown parser that supports standard Markdown features plus Mermaid code blocks, producing a structured representation that could be rendered to HTML with special handling for Mermaid diagrams.

I choose Rust as programming language and i use ChatGPT-5.2 to help me in the development process.
